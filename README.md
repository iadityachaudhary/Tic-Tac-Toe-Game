-**Win Detection:** The game checks all possible winning combinations after each turn to determine if there is a winner.
-**Draw Condition:** If all nine boxes are filled and there is no winner, a draw is declared.
-**Game Reset:** The "Reset" and "New Game" buttons clear the board and reset all variables.
